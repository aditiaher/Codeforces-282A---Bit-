# Codeforces-282A---Bit-
You're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of x is 0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).
Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.
Next n lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable x (denoted as letter «X»). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.
Output
Print a single integer — the final value of x.
